eyelashes on mammals protect the eye from airborne particles by redirecting airflow	0
eyelashes redirecting airflows around eyes constitute a passive mechanism to help keep the eye surface clean	0
they project away from the eye's sensitive surface and alter the flow of incoming air that may be carrying foreign particles	0
simulations of airflows around eyes with no lashesx long lashes, and intermediate length lashes show that eye surfaces with lashes of an intermediate length should experience weaker flows	0
without lashes, there is nothing to shield the eye from incoming airflows that can deposit foreign particles onto the eye	0
this layer of stagnant air has weaker flows, which leads to fewer airborne particles landing on the eyes surface	0

feet of the tokay gecko use atomic forces to stick to surfaces, but stay clean by flinging contaminants off toes	1
geckos are renowned for the sticky feet that enable them to climb a variety of surfaces	1
their toe pads are covered in millions of small hair-like projections called setae, which are each about 100 gm long and 5 gm in diameter	1
geckos appear to keep their sticky feet clean and functional through dynamic self-cleaning	1
when the setae at the tip of the toe are first pulledx they stretch a little and store elastic energy as the spatulae are still attached to the surface	1
this dynamic mechanism appears to work in concert with other passive mechanisms for self-cleaning, like particle removal that results when contaminants are more attracted to the substrate than the gecko foot	1
