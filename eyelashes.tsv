eyelashes on mammals protect the eye from airborne particles by redirecting airflow	1		
eyelashes redirecting airflows around eyes constitute a passive mechanism to help keep the eye surface clean	1		
they project away from the eye's sensitive surface and alter the flow of incoming air that may be carrying foreign particles	1		
simulations of airflows around eyes with no lashes 	 long lashes	 and intermediate length lashes show that eye surfaces with lashes of an intermediate length should experience weaker flows	1
without lashes 	 there is nothing to shield the eye from incoming airflows that can deposit foreign particles onto the eye	1	
this layer of stagnant air has weaker flows 	 which leads to fewer airborne particles landing on the eye ��s surface	1	
eyelashes redirecting airflows around eyes constitute a passive mechanism to help keep the eye surface clean	1		
feet of the tokay gecko use atomic forces to stick to surfaces 	 but stay clean by flinging contaminants off toes	2	
geckos are renowned for the sticky feet that enable them to climb a variety of surfaces	2		
their toe pads are covered in millions of small hair-like projections called setae 	 which are each about 100 �gm long and 5 �gm in diameter	2	
geckos appear to keep their sticky feet clean and functional through dynamic self-cleaning	2		
when the setae at the tip of the toe are first pulled 	 they stretch a little and store elastic energy as the spatulae are still attached to the surface	2	
this dynamic mechanism appears to work in concert with other passive mechanisms for self-cleaning 	 like particle removal that results when contaminants are more attracted to the substrate than the gecko foot	2
